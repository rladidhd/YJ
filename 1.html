<p>You talk about something that shouldnt be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow)
<strong>Calling security, <u>keeping</u> my head hold down</strong>
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now
Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day</P>
<p style="margin-top:45px;">I just wish you could feel what you say
Show, never tell
But I know you too well
Kind of mood that you wish you could sell
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told a tight dress is what makes you a whore
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you anymore
Hands. hands getting cold
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?</P>
